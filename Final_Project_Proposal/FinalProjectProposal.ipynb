    "For students who seek to pursue a college education in Singapore, only a few have access to a liberal arts education. This means that very early on -- potentially even before they apply for college -- students need to make decisions on what their college majors might be. This is a relatively consequential decision to make. This project aims to provide a package in Python for Singaporean Pre-University students (i.e., roughly 17-18 year old students) to help them make informed, data-driven decisions on their college majors. Specifically, through the `data.gov.sg` API, this package aims to provide two sets of functionality for students:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide them with information on the projected starting income levels, and full-time employment rates of all possible higher education choices they could make.\n",
    "2. Enable them to have a sense of the job vacancy rates in various industries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by providing using **functions**, **visualizations** and **easily accessible understandable tabular information**, based on data from two ongoing surveys that are published on the `data.gov.sg` API: the a) Annual Graduate Employment Survey (done on all six autonomous universities in Singapore - Nanyang Technological University(NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore Management University (SMU), Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS), and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)) and b) the Quarterly Job Vacancy Rate by Industry and Occupational Group. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use some of the data fields that are publicly available, regarding these two surveys, through the `data.gov.sg` API. I will elaborate on which ones in this next section:"
