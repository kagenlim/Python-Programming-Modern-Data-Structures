# kagen_lim

Hi there, my name is Kagen! I was trained in Psychology at the National University of Singapore, before I decided to dive deeper into quantitative methods here at Columbia. 

I'm really excited about this course, because I am somewhat new to Python, and I certainly feel like I am learning a lot from every lesson. 

My email contact is [kagen.lim@columbia.edu](mailto:kagen.lim@columbia.edu).
